## Setup

The Circuit Playground Express looks for a Python script named _code.py_ or _main.py_ in the root
directory of its boot drive. Therefore to run any script in this repo, just copy it to the root.

You may also have to
[update your boot loader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/updating-the-bootloader)
first.
